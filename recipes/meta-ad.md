# Recipe: Meta Ad Creative

Static ad creative for Facebook / Instagram feed and Reels covers. `gpt-image-2` is strong
here for two reasons: (1) hook text rendered legibly directly in the image, (2) multi-reference
composition lets you fuse a product shot, a lifestyle scene, and a brand mark in one creative.

## When to use

- Single-image ad creative for Meta feed, Stories, or Reels covers
- "Hook overlay" creatives — bold text statement on top of a scene
- Product + lifestyle composition (multi-reference shines here)
- Founder / testimonial framed creatives

## When NOT to use

- Animated or video ads → use video tooling
- Pure product on white (e-comm catalog) → cheaper models do this fine
- Carousel ads → build per-slide and assemble separately

## Defaults

- **Size:** `1024x1024` (feed square), `1024x1536` (Stories / Reels 9:16-ish), `1536x1024` (landscape feed)
- **Quality:** `high`
- **Model:** `gpt-image-2`

## Prompt skeleton (single-image)

```
Static social ad creative, [PLATFORM: Facebook feed / Instagram Stories / Reels cover].

Hook (large text overlay, top of frame): "[HOOK COPY — under 12 words]"

Scene: [DESCRIBE THE SCENE — subject, setting, mood, time of day, camera framing].

Subject: [PERSON / PRODUCT — appearance, pose, expression, what they're doing].

Style: [photographic / illustrated / mixed], [lighting style], [color grade].
Brand cues: [LOGO PLACEMENT / WORDMARK / COLOR ACCENTS].

Typography: hook in [SANS / SERIF / DISPLAY] [WEIGHT], color [COLOR], placed [POSITION].
Render the hook text exactly as written — do not paraphrase or invent words.
Leave a clean lower third for a CTA button overlay (do not draw the CTA).
```

## Worked example: SaaS product ad

```
Static social ad creative, Instagram feed (1:1 square).

Hook (large text overlay, top half of frame): "STOP WRITING PROMPTS. START SHIPPING WORK."

Scene: Modern over-the-shoulder shot of a founder at a clean desk, late afternoon golden light from a window on the right. Laptop open showing a software interface (no specific brand). Coffee cup, notebook, plant in soft focus.

Subject: 30s founder in a charcoal sweater, calm focused expression, hands on keyboard.

Style: photographic, editorial, warm but neutral color grade, shallow depth of field.
Brand cues: small wordmark "ACME" in white, bottom-right corner.

Typography: hook in bold condensed sans-serif (Druk / Inter Display Bold), white with a thin black outline for legibility, placed in the upper third with generous margin.
Render the hook text exactly as written — do not paraphrase or invent words.
Leave a clean lower third for a CTA button overlay (do not draw the CTA).
```

## Worked example: Multi-reference (product + lifestyle + brand)

Use `--reference-image` 2-3 times. Reference shots: product hero, lifestyle scene, brand asset.

```bash
node tools/generate.js \
  --prompt "Compose a Meta feed ad: place the product from reference 1 onto the kitchen counter scene from reference 2. Add the wordmark from reference 3 in the bottom-right corner in white. Hook text top-center: 'BREAKFAST IN 90 SECONDS'. Bold condensed sans, cream color, thin shadow. Photographic, morning light, warm color grade. 1:1 square." \
  --reference-image ./product-hero.png \
  --reference-image ./kitchen-scene.png \
  --reference-image ./wordmark.png \
  --size 1024x1024 \
  --output ./ad-creative.png
```

## Composition tips

- **One hook only.** Two competing texts in one ad = scroll-past.
- **Quote the exact hook copy in the prompt** with the instruction "render exactly as written" — otherwise the model paraphrases.
- **Specify hook position** ("upper third", "centered", "bottom") — placement is otherwise random.
- **Reserve the CTA area.** Tell the model to "leave the lower third clean for a CTA button overlay" — you composite the button later in your ad manager.
- **Brand asset as reference image** beats describing the logo in text. Logos are nearly always wrong when described.
- **For lifestyle composition**, pass the lifestyle scene FIRST, the product SECOND. The model anchors layout to the first reference.

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Hook text misspelled / paraphrased | Add: "render the hook text exactly as written — do not paraphrase or invent words" |
| Logo wrong | Pass the logo as a reference image instead of describing it |
| Composition busy | Cap scene to 1-2 props; explicitly state "shallow depth of field" or "minimal background" |
| Two texts competing for attention | Remove the secondary text; reserve space for compositing CTA later |
| Faces look generic | Describe age, expression, clothing, posture concretely; reference image of the founder works best |
