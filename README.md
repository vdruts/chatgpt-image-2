# chatgpt-image-2

A [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill for OpenAI's `gpt-image-2` — wired for the three jobs it actually wins at: **editorial typography, multi-image composition, and dense infographics.**

Not a wrapper. Not a toy. A thin, opinionated surface that routes text-to-image and multi-reference edits through one command, with prompt recipes that have been stress-tested against the cases where `gpt-image-2` earns its cost premium over Gemini / Nano Banana.

---

## Why this exists

`nano-banana` (Gemini) is the right default for single images — faster, cheaper, single-reference. This skill is for the three cases where `gpt-image-2` is genuinely better:

1. **Legible typography inside the image.** Posters, magazine spreads, infographics with real headlines and body copy. Text rendering accuracy sits above 95% across Latin, CJK, and Arabic scripts — the other models still smear letters.
2. **True multi-reference composition.** The Edits endpoint accepts up to 16 reference images and combines them into one scene. Pass `product + lifestyle + brand asset`, get one image back. Gemini takes one reference at a time.
3. **Structured layouts.** Grids, hierarchy, spacing, "do exactly this" prompts. `gpt-image-2` follows spatial instructions rather than hallucinating a vibe.

If your prompt doesn't touch any of those, use `nano-banana`. This skill will work but you'll pay more for output you could have gotten cheaper elsewhere.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vdruts/chatgpt-image-2 ~/.claude/skills/chatgpt-image-2
cd ~/.claude/skills/chatgpt-image-2
npm install
```

Claude Code auto-discovers skills in `~/.claude/skills/`. Restart your session and the `chatgpt-image-2` skill is available.

## Configure

Two one-time things:

1. **API key.** Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment, or drop it into `~/.claude/.env`. The tool checks `process.env`, then `./.env`, then `~/.claude/.env`, then `<skill-dir>/.env`.

2. **Organization verification.** OpenAI gates `gpt-image-2` behind ID-based org verification. [platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general) → Verify Organization. Takes ~2 minutes; propagation to the API can take 15-30 more. Until it clears you'll get `403 Your organization must be verified`.

## Use from Claude Code

Once installed, just describe what you want in natural language. The skill's triggers route requests involving "infographic", "meta ad", "viral LinkedIn image", "combine these images", or explicit mentions of "ChatGPT Images" / "gpt-image-2".

Example prompts that route here:

- *"Make me an infographic on the 5 stages of customer awareness."*
- *"Combine these 3 product photos into one lifestyle shot."*
- *"Create a viral LinkedIn image for a post on prompt engineering being dead."*

## Use from the CLI

### Text-to-image

```bash
node tools/generate.js \
  --prompt 'Editorial magazine cover. Bold serif headline reading "PRECISION" in black ink on a cream background. Geometric red and black accents, Bauhaus-inspired. No extra text.' \
  --size 1024x1536 \
  --quality high \
  --output ./cover.png
```

### Multi-image composition

Pass `--reference-image` multiple times. The tool switches to the Edits endpoint and composes:

```bash
node tools/generate.js \
  --prompt 'A premium gift basket on a white studio background. Image 1: body lotion, placed at back-left. Image 2: candle, placed center. Image 3: soap, placed front-right. Add a cream ribbon and a handwritten "Relax & Unwind" label. Preserve product labels exactly.' \
  --reference-image ./body-lotion.png \
  --reference-image ./candle.png \
  --reference-image ./soap.png \
  --output ./giftbasket.png
```

### All options

```
--prompt "<text>"               Required. Image description.
--reference-image <path>        Repeatable (up to 16). Adds a reference. Triggers Edits endpoint.
--output <path>                 Output path. Default: ./output.png
--size <size>                   1024x1024 | 1024x1536 | 1536x1024 | auto. Default: auto
--quality <quality>             low | medium | high | auto. Default: high
--model <model>                 gpt-image-2 | gpt-image-1.5 | gpt-image-1 | gpt-image-1-mini.
                                Default: gpt-image-2
--moderation <level>            auto | low. Default: auto
--n <count>                     Number of images to generate (1-4). Default: 1
```

## Prompting playbook

Distilled from OpenAI's cookbook guide, fal.ai's prompting notes, and a stack of real tests. Treat these as defaults, not dogma.

### 1. Structure beats length

Write your prompt in this order. Long rambling paragraphs underperform short labeled segments.

```
Scene / background  →  Subject  →  Key details  →  Typography  →  Constraints
```

Front-load what matters. `gpt-image-2` processes language sequentially — **the first ten words of your prompt carry the most visual weight.** If the headline is the point, say "Editorial poster with the headline 'X'" before describing the background.

### 2. Text rendering rules

This is where `gpt-image-2` earns its premium. Use the rules or you'll lose them.

- **Always quote the exact text.** `'a poster reading "SHIPPED"'`. Unquoted text gets paraphrased.
- **Specify placement and typography.** Font style (serif / sans / mono), size (large / medium / small), weight, color, and position. "Bold serif, centered, 40% of frame height, black on cream."
- **Demand verbatim rendering.** Add `no extra text`, `no duplicate letters`, `no hallucinated words`. Models love to sprinkle filler.
- **Spell out tricky words letter by letter** for brand names or non-dictionary terms: `the word "HORIZIN" (H-O-R-I-Z-I-N)`.
- **Use `--quality high`** for small text, dense information panels, and multi-font layouts. `medium` blurs fine type.
- **Put every piece of text in its own quoted phrase** if you have multiple copy blocks. "Headline 'X', subhead 'Y', CTA 'Z'." Don't run them together.

### 3. Multi-reference labeling pattern

When using the Edits endpoint with 2+ references, label every image by role and reference the labels in your instruction:

```
Image 1: base scene to preserve
Image 2: jacket to composite onto the subject in Image 1
Image 3: boots to composite onto the subject in Image 1
```

Then: *"Apply Image 2 and Image 3 to the subject in Image 1. Keep Image 1's lighting, background, and camera angle unchanged."*

Without labels, the model guesses which reference is canonical. With labels, it follows instructions.

### 4. Preserve-and-change language

For surgical edits, state both sides explicitly. The model drifts otherwise:

- **Change only:** `"Replace the jacket with the one from Image 2."`
- **Keep:** `"Keep the face, hair, pose, background, lighting, and color temperature unchanged."`

Repeat the preserve list on every iteration. Drift compounds across edits.

### 5. Lighting and materials

Lighting separates flat images from cinematic ones. Be specific:

- "Fluorescent ceiling light mixed with neon signage glow"
- "Dramatic orange-red gradient backlight, subject in silhouette"
- "Golden hour natural light, low angle, warm shadows"

Materials: name textures, surfaces, reflectivity. "Matte cream paper, no gloss." "Brushed aluminum with fingerprint smudges." Generic prompts produce generic images.

### 6. Quality levers (use sparingly)

Add these ONLY when the base prompt underdelivers. Stacking them turns output mushy:

- `film grain` / `35mm` for analog warmth
- `macro detail` / `shallow depth of field` for product shots
- `candid, unposed` to defeat the default polished-studio look
- `hand-drawn, pencil texture` for editorial illustration

### 7. Aspect ratio changes the story

A 3:2 landscape reads differently from a 2:3 portrait from a 1:1 square — even with the same prompt. Test at least two ratios for hero images. Default to `1024x1536` for LinkedIn/poster work, `1536x1024` for banners, `1024x1024` for everything else.

### 8. Output size reality check

Max resolution is flexible, but outputs above **2560×1440** (2K) are experimental. Results get variable. Stick to the three documented sizes unless you have a reason.

## Failure modes and fixes

From OpenAI's own cookbook + lived experience:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Text illegible or wrong characters | `--quality high`, quote the text, spell out tricky words letter-by-letter |
| Identity drifts across edits | Restate the preserve list every iteration |
| Unwanted creative reinterpretation | Add "no new elements", "preserve layout and perspective", lock specifics |
| Overpolished / stock-photo feel | Use "candid, unposed, natural light" instead of "studio, cinematic" |
| Duplicate / extra words appear | Add `no extra text`, `no duplicate letters`, `single headline only` |
| Compositing looks pasted-on | Name the lighting and shadows explicitly. "Match lighting from Image 1." |
| Slow generation (>60s) | Drop to `--quality medium`, or reduce reference image count |

## Costs

Per-call pricing is a function of size × quality × input image tokens (for multi-reference composition). Check [OpenAI pricing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing) for current numbers. Two rules of thumb:

- Text-to-image at `--quality low` is cheap enough to iterate freely.
- Multi-reference edits at `--quality high` stack token costs fast — every reference is processed at high fidelity. Budget accordingly.

---

## Limitations

- No transparent backgrounds on `gpt-image-2`. Omit `background: transparent` from prompts.
- Complex prompts can take up to 2 minutes. Plan for it.
- Org verification required (one-time, ~2 min + propagation).
- Subject to OpenAI rate limits — your tier determines throughput.

---

## When NOT to use this skill

- **Single quick image, no reference** → use `nano-banana` (Gemini). Faster, cheaper.
- **Multi-slide carousel deck** → use a carousel-specific tool (Visual Forge, pipeline-carousel).
- **Realtime / streaming generation** → not supported by `gpt-image-2`.
- **Transparent PNGs** → not supported. Composite externally or use a different model.
